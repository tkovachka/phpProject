# PHP PROJECTS REPOSITORY
This is a repository for different exercises in PHP, although all similar, for the purposes of the subject "Implementing systems with free and open code" at [FSCE](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/).
All of them are located on different branches. Get them by checking out the project branch:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tkovachka/phpProject
cd phpProject
git checkout <project-name-branch>
```
There are instructions for use on each of the branches.
